# Caves and Cliffs Expansion Pack
This datapack was created with the intention to replicate a unreleased feature of Minecraft Caves & Cliffs, the cave biome generation. This datapack adds the two main biomes from the update (Besides Deep Dark). The Lush Caves biome and the Dripstone Caves biome. This datapack is integrated with the official Mojang "Caves and Cliffs Preview" datapack, the only thing you have to do is apply this datapack in your minecraft new world folder.

Disclaimer: This datapack is totally experimental. I do not grant compatibility with versions he was not made for.
